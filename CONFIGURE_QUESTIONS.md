# How to Configure Questions

## Easy Question Management

All questions are now in one file: **`js/questions-config.js`**

## How to Remove/Add Questions

Open `js/questions-config.js` and find the question you want to change.

### To REMOVE a question:
Change `enabled: true` to `enabled: false`

**Example:**
```javascript
// This question will NOT appear
{ id: 15, enabled: false, type: "canvas", text: "Sketch our RK (our future home)" },
```

### To ADD it back:
Change `enabled: false` to `enabled: true`

**Example:**
```javascript
// This question WILL appear
{ id: 15, enabled: true, type: "canvas", text: "Sketch our RK (our future home)" },
```

### Want ONLY June 15 specific questions?
